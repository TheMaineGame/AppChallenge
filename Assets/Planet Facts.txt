It is the only planet having life. .

Venus Facts. Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is the second brightest object in the night sky after the Moon. Named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, Venus is the second largest terrestrial planet and is sometimes referred to as the Earth's sister planet due the their similar size and mass.

Venus is surrounded by thick cloud cover ,that is why it is called "Veiled Planet"

Mercury Facts. Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and is also the smallest of the eight planets in our solar system. For every 2 orbits of the Sun, which takes around 88 Earth days, Mercury completes three rotations of its axis. It is gravitationally locked and this rotation is unique to the solar system.
Mass: 330,104,000,000,000 billion kg (0.055 x Earth)
Equatorial Diameter: 4,879
Polar Diameter: 4,879
Known Moons: none
Mercury is named after messenger of the Roman gods. 

Mars Facts. Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. Named after the Roman god of war, and often described as the “Red Planet” due to its reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide.
Mass:	641 x 10^24 kg (0.107 x Earth)
Equatorial Diameter:	6,805 km
Polar Diameter:	6,755 km
Known Moons:	2
The gravity of Mars is half of the earth . 

Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It’s not visible to the naked eye, and became the first planet discovered with the use of a telescope. Uranus is tipped over on its side with an axial tilt of 98 degrees. It is often described as “rolling around the Sun on its side.”
Mass: 86,810,300,000,000,000 billion kg (14.536 x Earth)
Equatorial Diameter: 51,118 km
Polar Diameter: 49,946 km
Known Moons: 27
Known Rings: 13
Uranus is named after the Roman god of the sky. . 

Neptune Facts. Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun making it the most distant in the solar system. This gas giant planet may have formed much closer to the Sun in early solar system history before migrating to its present position.
Mass: 102,410,000,000,000,000 billion kg (17.15x Earth)
Equatorial Diameter: 49,528 km
Polar Diameter: 48,682 km
Known Moons: 14
Known Rings: 5
There is a large white cloud in Neptune's atmosphere, that moves around rather quickly.It has been named Scooter due to its scooting around the atmosphere.

Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the most distant that can be seen with the naked eye. It is best known for its fabulous ring system that was discovered in 1610 by the astronomer Galileo Galilei.
Mass: 568,319,000,000,000,000 billion kg (95.16 x Earth)
Equatorial Diameter: 120,536 km
Polar Diameter: 108,728 km
Known Moons: 62
Known Rings: 30+ (7 Groups)
Saturn has such a low density that it would float if put in water! 

The planet Jupiter is the fifth planet out from the Sun, and is two and a half times more massive than all the other planets in the solar system combined. It is made primarily of gases and is therefore known as a “gas giant”.
Mass: 1,898,130,000,000,000,000 billion kg (317.83 x Earth)
Equatorial Diameter: 142,984 km
Polar Diameter: 133,709 km
